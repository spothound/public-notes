- **Phishing:** when someone pretend to be a legitimate source and send you a malicious email/text/SMS with the objective of making you click in a dangerous link or download a problematic file.
- **Pharming:** Phishing sent to large groups of people.
- **Vishing:** voice phishing via phone or voicemail.
- **Smishing** (SMS Phishing): Phishing through SMS.
- **Social engineering**: 
- **Spoofing:** Spoofing is a fraudulent act in which communication from an unknown source is disguised as being from a source that is known to and trusted by the recipient. In its most primitive form, spoofing refers to **impersonation via telephone**. Other types: **Email Spoofing**, **DNS Spoofing**, **IP Spoofing**, **DDoS Spoofing**, **ARP Spoofing**... 
- **Pretexting:** Pretexting is a **certain type of social engineering technique that manipulates victims into divulging information**. A pretext is a made-up scenario developed by threat actors for the purpose of stealing a victim's personal data.
- Poisoned DNS (DNS spoofing) -> hack a DNS server to server malicious IPs instead of the correct ones when asked for a domain name resolution. 
- **Impersonation**: pretend to be someone else (usually with pretexting).
- **Dumpster diving**: collect information from the trash thrown by a target. One interesting thing to avoid this is shred any document that you will throw away (cut it into small pieces).
- **Shoulder surfing**: when someone "look over your shoulder" while you are working with delicate/important files/services to gather information about you or your company/org.
- **Privacy filters**: black everything in a screen for anyone who isn't directly in front of the screen.
- **Hoax/Hoaxes**: a threat that doesn't actually exists but seems that COULD be real, consuming our resources (time, energy, CPU).
- **De-hoaxing**: consider the source, trust no one. Spam filters can help. If it sounds to good to be true, it isn't. Cross reference (hoax-slayer.net, snopes.com)
- **Watering hole attack**: when the target is secure enough to prevent threats, attackers can attack third-party services used by the organization and use those to infect the targets. It could be just a coffee or shop next to a company's office, it could happen to a website, a DNS, API service... it can be prevented with firewalls and IPS configurations as well as good antivirus. 

## Detecting Phishing emails
- There is usually something wrong with the page: images not loading well or grammar errors. Also the domain name can be very similar to the expected one but will have an small error (this is Typosquatting, for example www.gooogle.com has 3 Os instead of 2).
- They put some type of situation in place, and they try to see if they can get you to act on it. For example, they may have a message that they’re calling with or an email that says, hi, we’re calling from Visa regarding an automated payment to your utility service. And then they might have click on something or offer to provide that particular payment over the phone.

## Complex phishing attacks
- When the phishing targets an specific person and his performed after a reconnaissance phase were the attacker gathers personal information from the victim in order to make a believable pretext. 
- A lot of public information is available on internet: LinkedIn, twitter, Facebook, Instagram...
- If it is directed to someone with big influence or a lot of money it is called **whaling**
