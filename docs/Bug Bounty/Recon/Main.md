## Subdomain enumeration
This technique increase our attack surface by collecting others domains (subdomains) that are part of the target scope but are not listed by default in the program description.

Some tools for subdomain enumeration are:
-   [Subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder)
-   [Assetfinder](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder)
-   [Dnsenum](https://github.com/fwaeytens/dnsenum)
-   [Google Dorking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking)
-   [Dnsdumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/)
